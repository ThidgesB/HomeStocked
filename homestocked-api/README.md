## Running the server

It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2022. 

* Double-click the solution file (HomestockedAPI.sln) found in the root of the API's project directory to load the project, and press CTRL + F5 (or the triangle-shaped play button near the top of your window) to start the server.
* The console will display the port on which your server is running.
* Press CTRL and left-click the link in the console to open a tab in Chrome.
* The newly-opened tab should display the Swagger page. You can use Swagger to manually test the API's CRUD functionality.
